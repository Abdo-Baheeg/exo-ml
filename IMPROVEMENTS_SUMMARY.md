- **Dataset Usage** - Bar chart showing predictions by dataset
- **Prediction Timeline** - Scatter plot showing predictions over time with confidence levels

✅ **Improved Table**:
- Visual progress bars for confidence scores
- Color-coded result badges (green for exoplanets, red for false positives)
- Dataset tags with distinct styling
- Better mobile responsiveness

### Visual Improvements
- Gradient backgrounds for cards
- Professional color scheme with semantic colors
- Better hover states and transitions

## 🔧 Notebook Fixes

### Kepler Notebook
**Issues Fixed:**
- ❌ Missing confusion matrix plots
- ❌ Missing ROC curve plots  
- ❌ Missing feature importance plots
- ❌ No training columns saved
- ❌ No feature medians saved
- ❌ Inconsistent file naming

**Solutions:**
✅ Added plot generation in `evaluate_models()`:
- Confusion matrix saved as `Kepler_{ModelName}_confusion.png`
- ROC curves saved as `Kepler_{ModelName}_roc.png`

✅ Enhanced `extract_and_save_feature_importances()`:
- Now saves both JSON data and visual plots
- Structured JSON: `{"features": [...], "importances": [...]}`
- Plots saved as `Kepler_{ModelName}_topk.png`

✅ Added metadata files:
- `Kepler_training_columns.json` - Column names for predictions
- `Kepler_feature_medians.json` - Default values for missing features

### K2 Notebook  
**Issues Fixed:**
- ❌ Used "local_k2" prefix instead of "K2"
- ❌ Nested JSON structure `{"meta": {...}, "results": {...}}`
- ❌ Missing plots for some models
- ❌ Inconsistent artifact naming

**Solutions:**
✅ Changed dataset name from "local_k2" to "K2":
- Updated `run_full_workflow('K2')` call
- Fixed `get_dataset_path()` mapping

✅ Simplified metrics JSON structure:
- Changed from nested to flat: `{"ModelName": {"accuracy": 0.99, ...}}`
- Matches Kepler and TESS format

✅ Enhanced plot generation:
- Added confusion matrix plots
- Added ROC curve plots  
- Added feature importance plots
- All with "K2_" prefix

✅ Improved `extract_and_save_top_features()`:
- Structured JSON with features + importances
- Visual plots for all models

## 📦 Artifact Parser Enhancements

### New Structure
Enhanced `notebook_parser.py` with comprehensive artifact categorization:

```json
{
  "artifacts": {
    "models": {
      "count": 3,
      "files": ["static/models/RandomForest_pipeline.pkl", ...]
    },
    "plots": {
      "count": 9,
      "by_type": {
        "confusion_matrices": ["Kepler_RandomForest_confusion.png", ...],
        "roc_curves": ["Kepler_RandomForest_roc.png", ...],
        "feature_importance": ["Kepler_RandomForest_topk.png", ...]
      }
    },
    "data_files": {
      "metrics": "static/results/Kepler_metrics.json",
      "training_columns": "static/results/Kepler_training_columns.json",
      "feature_medians": "static/results/Kepler_feature_medians.json",
      "top_features": [...]
    }
  }
}
```

### Features
✅ **Categorized Artifacts**:
- Models separated with count
- Plots organized by type (confusion, ROC, features)
- Data files clearly identified

✅ **Better Metrics Parsing**:
- Handles both flat and nested JSON structures
- Automatically finds best model
- Converts to percentages for display

✅ **Comprehensive Next Steps**:
- Model-specific guidance
- Plot availability info
- API usage examples
- Configuration status
