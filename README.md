# ðŸŒŒ Exoplanets Detection Using Machine Learning

This project is designed to help cosmology scientists and researchers save time by automating the detection of exoplanets using machine learning techniques.  
By uploading data, the system automatically builds multiple models, allow the user to change hyperparameters for the models, evaluates them, and displays performance metrics â€” making the research workflow faster and more efficient.
